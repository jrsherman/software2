# software2
Insurance Saas
Software developed for Software 2 class at St. Edwards. This project was very compartmentalized. Each member of a 6 person team
had their own job to complete to realize project goals and deadlines. Jake Sherman was in charge of UX UI and coding this.
Documentation is quite robust for this project and 9/10 of project goals were met. 

Software download was pushed to next sprint. 

The website itself was shutdown, but a mock up version of what the front end looked like is available through a link on http://jakesherman.info
